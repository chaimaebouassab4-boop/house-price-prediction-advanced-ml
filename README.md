# 🏡 Ames Housing Price Prediction — End-to-End Data Pipeline (Talend · Power BI · Machine Learning · Streamlit)

This repository contains a **complete real-world Data Science & Data Engineering project** built by **Ghizlane** and **Chaimae**.
It covers the full lifecycle of a predictive analytics solution — from **raw data extraction** to a **deployed interactive web app**.

The project is based on the **Ames Housing dataset**, a modern alternative to the Boston Housing dataset, widely used to practice machine learning and price prediction tasks.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to **predict house sale prices** in Ames, Iowa using advanced Machine Learning techniques.

To achieve this, we built a **full end-to-end workflow**:

✔ Extract and transform data with **Talend**
✔ Perform EDA and feature engineering
✔ Train and evaluate ML models
✔ Build insights dashboards with **Power BI**
✔ Deploy an interactive **Streamlit** application for predictions

This project demonstrates real-world skills in **data engineering**, **business intelligence**, **machine learning**, and **application deployment**.

## 📘 About the Ames Housing Dataset

The **Ames Housing dataset** contains **79 explanatory features** describing residential homes in Ames, Iowa (USA).
It is widely used for teaching and benchmarking regression models.

Target variable:
🟦 `SalePrice` — sale price of each house.

This dataset is used in a Kaggle competition focused on **RMSE of log-transformed prices**.
